# Azure Gitea Demo Configuration
# Using Azure MySQL Flexible Server for production-ready setup

# Gitea version
gitea_version: "1.25.2"

# Database: Azure MySQL Flexible Server (configured automatically via generate_inventory.sh)
# Production-ready setup with external database

# =============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Pre-configure Admin User
# =============================================================================
# Uncomment the following lines to automatically create an admin user
# during deployment. If these variables are not set, the first user
# to register through the web UI will automatically become admin.

gitea_admin_username: "admin"
gitea_admin_password: "ChangeThisSecurePassword123!"
gitea_admin_email: "admin@example.com"

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# =============================================================================
# 1. CHANGE the default password before using in production
# 2. Consider using Ansible Vault to encrypt credentials:
#    ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/all.yml
# 3. After first login, admin should change their password
# 4. For production, consider using Azure Key Vault or environment variables
# 5. Never commit unencrypted passwords to version control

# =============================================================================
# ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION (Without Predefined Admin)
# =============================================================================
# If you prefer NOT to create an admin automatically, simply comment out
# or delete the three gitea_admin_* variables above.
#
# In that case:
# - The first user to register will automatically become admin
# - DISABLE_REGISTRATION = false (registration is open)
# - Each team can choose their own credentials
# - Ideal for development and demo environments
